After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.

1. What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?
  - I currently work in health insurance and am in a customer facing role.
  - I help small businesses transfer their benefits to my company.
  - Along the way, I look for any employee or plan level errors.
  - Let me tell you, customers freak out when they find out their health insurance isn't setup as perfectly as they thought.
  - Without carrying a serious amount of empathy in this role, I would never have been successful.
  - It's helped me identify with the customer and realize if there were ever a moment to be fussy, boy this is it.

1. How does empathy help you build better software?
  - Having empathy for your users helps you build a more fluid program
  - keeping the UX in mind will help develop more streamlined functions and prompts.
  - Empathy also helps keep that little voice in the back of your mind saying "You're going to have to touch this code again. Clean this up!"
  - No one wants to wade through your ramblings in hopes of figuring out your intentions.

1. Why is empathy important for working on a team?
  - At Turing, I'll need all the empathy I can get.
  - There will be days I'm intimidated beyond belief, days I feel like a crappy programmer, days nothing will make sense.
  - I'd imagine those around me will have these days too - without empathy, none of us would grow into the developers we can be.
  - I try my best to assume positive intent in all scenarios in hopes of fostering a trust based environment.

1. Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.
  - Almost every day in my current role, it can be wearing to work with customers day in and day out.
  - I've helped build my team to recognize when someone is just needs a break.
  - Whether that be a team coffee run, a walk around downtown, or an ear to bend, being able to pickup on my teammates stress has made me a better leader and built trust across my team.
  - My team has implemented a "hear me, help me, do it for me" practice where when we just need to vent, we have a space and forum for this.

1. When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?
  - When I am in moments of high stress.
  - For example, if I am on a tight deadline or working on an complex problem and someone interupts me,
  - I find it very challenging to not visibly show I am annoyed (because I am stressed).
  - I try my best to say things like "Hey I am right in the middle of something, can we connect in 15 minutes?"
  - However, I am human and sometimes can revert to curt replies when I am feeling particularly rushed.
